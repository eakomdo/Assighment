#A program that asks a user to enter two numbers, and then performs basic arithmetic operations on them

num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))

print(f"The sum of {num1} and {num2} is {num1 + num2}")
print(f"The difference of {num1} and {num2} is {num1 - num2}")
print(f"The product of {num1} and {num2} is {num1 * num2}")
print(f"The quotient of {num1} and {num2} is {num1 / num2}")
print(f"The modulus of {num1} and {num2} is {num1 % num2}")
